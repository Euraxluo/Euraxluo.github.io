## Usages

It's easy to use a hook, what you need to do is that create an HTML file with the same name as hook in the `layouts/partials/hooks` directory.

Let's take `sidebar-begin` as an example:

```shell
echo '<section class="row card component text-center"><div class="card-body">SIDEBAR BEGIN</div></section>' \
  > layouts/partials/hooks/sidebar-begin.html
```
